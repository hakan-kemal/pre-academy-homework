        <p>Hi there! My name is Hakan and with this website I would like to <a href="about-me.html" class="introduce" target="_blank">introduce myself.</a> I am half Dutch, half Turkish, and born in the Netherlands. I also lived a few years in Turkey, but mostly lived in Amsterdam, a really cool city BTW! There is a lot more to share, but will keep it short and relevant.</p>
        <p>I recently quit my previous job because I did not enjoy my work anymore and found it increasingly difficult to motivate myself. So as a lot of people trying to figure out what could be a more fun, challenging, and interesting career path I stumbled upon coding. I noticed that I really liked it and wanted to know more about it. I tried some stuff on my own, but working full time and studying in my remaining free time I found it difficult to learn coding. So I decided if I really want this than I have to invest full time to succeed. You gotta go big or go home, right?</p>
        <p>To relax I really enjoy being physically active, so I spend most of my free time climbing, running (OCR actually), and cycling. Of course to relax I also like meeting up with my friends to hang out, catch up, and have fun and laugh a lot!<br/>Did you know laughing is healthy, like really, really <a href="https://bestlifeonline.com/health-benefits-laughter/" target="_blank">healthy?</a></p>
        <p>Thanks for visiting my personal website which I created in preparation for the Codaisseur Code Academy. I hope you like the page I created, It took me quite some time by trying all types of different code which resulted in some messed up and mixed up CSS, so I got a little messy on the code, sorry! ;) Browse through the pages and the code of my website and leave a nice comment at our slack channel!</p>
